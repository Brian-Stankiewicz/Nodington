# Than Rockbottom's Background

I grew up in the town of Millboro mining the Restful Mountains for the Rem Crystal.

When I was 10-years old I actually died (or came close to dying) when the "sleepless" attacked our mining village and captured me and my family and burned us at the stake. At that time I and walked between the realms of the living and the dead. Desna came to me and showed me a vision of a great battle between me and [Urgathoa](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Urgathoa) and many others. After the vision of **The Great Battle** Desna showed me a second vision of her guiding and protecting my Father Jagrus, my Mother Mothola and my Sister Thelmeai on the journey into the heavens which they safely arrived--for this I was eternally grateful.

When they found us, we were all badly burned. My mother, father, sister and me were all dead. The priestess Bostidrid Windchest from the Temple of Desna came to pray over the dead bodies for safe passage into the Heavenly realm. When laying hands on me the Bostidrid saw the same vision of **The Great Battle** and coming out of her trans  she saw that I awoke from death.

Bostidrid and I only spoke of this vision once. Bostidrid said that I cannot tell anyone about the vision because it would put me in great danger. She said that she would do everything to protect me and to prepare me for **The Great Battle**. To this end she carefully selected families that she trusted in the village to foster me until I came of age. These were families that she not only trusted but that she felt would be able to teach me the necessary skills for **The Great Battle**. I was passed from family to family which taught me a little about a lot of things but I was never in a family long enough to learn any one skill well. The Bostidrid didn't start my training as a cleric until after I came of age and my fiancé left Millboro in a distraught state due to my visions. This late training made my skills and approaches a bit unorthodox for a cleric of Desna.

## Sleepless Antagonist

Having my family killed and nearly dying has made me a **Sleepless Antagonist**.  When I go into battle with a Sleepless my rage is so powerful that I go into transformational rage. During battle I recite prayers to Desna in the name of my family. I am not in control during these times and I am unable to recollect the battles but only recall being in the "middle-realm" searching for my family. I find these periods of rage terrifying and I continue to meditate and pray to Desna to remove this curse.

## Connection with Desna

Desna has "blessed" or "cursed" me with very powerful dreams that have been prophetic, deeply insightful, and filled with extraordinary solutions to problems that plagued me. The "curse" has been that the dreams only show me "incomplete portions" of the prophecy which makes these prophecies very difficult. For example, I was nearly married and I saw my fiancé Raenselle Emberbrow with a large bag of gold and I excitedly told her that "great fortune!" was in her future. Two weeks later her father unexpectedly died and left Raenselle his family fortune. Raenselle never forgave me for being jubilant about such an awful event. Following her father's death Raenselle left Millboro in great grief from her father's death and anger toward me--we haven't spoken for 20 years and this event still haunts me. Because of this and other similar experiences, I rarely share my prophetic dreams. Furthermore, my dreams typically are about those that I care deeply about so I am very guarded in my relationships. However, because my family died at such a young age I find that I tend to deeply care for those around in spite of my efforts not to do so.

### Relationship with Desna

My relationship with Desna is "complicated". On the one hand I resent having these incomplete prophetic visions (and what it has done to my life) along with being asked me to "leave" my family in the middle-realm so that I could help her defeat [Urgathoa](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Urgathoa). On the other hand, it was clear from the visions that my family would not have safely entered the heavenly plane without her guidance and protection.  

## Skills

Because my family died at such a young age, I was raised by the Millboro village. I spent time with many families including the miller, many mining families, the blacksmith but in my later years I spent most of my time in the Temple of Desna. The priestess was very careful not to signal my role in **The Great Battle** for fear of tipping off [Urgathoa](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Urgathoa) and putting me into grave danger.

# Character Strengths and Flaws

I "*carry the weight of the world*" on my shoulders. In my long life I have lost much and I have felt responsibility of righting many wrongs. I am beginning to doubt my visions of **The Great Battle** and I am beginning to grow even more resentful of the price that I have had to pay in my life. Because my dreams are filled with prophecy and I am able to control my dreams, my time meditating is the only time that I truly feel peace and rest.

## Character features

I am loyal and I am an amazing fighter when I believe what I am fighting for. I will protect those that I care about to the point of self-sacrifice. In many ways I have a death wish but Desna seems to continue to protect me which I have mixed feelings about.

I am socially awkward and blunt. I have a lot on my mind and I am carrying a lot on my shoulders so I don't have a lot of patience for frivolous chit chat. I don't care too much about "things" but given what is on my mind, I spend much of my loot on mead either at the local pub or from my magic bottomless flask. I have made many friends in pubs and I have created many enemies. Many of these I may not be aware of since I often times cannot remember the previous evening.
